<h2> About Me </h2> 
<p> Danielle Ball is a Summa Cum Laude graduate of the University of Florida with a Bachelor of Science in Telecommunication and a Bachelor of Art in Political Science. She currently resides in sunny South Florida where she runs her own business, helps manage her parent’s business, works as a signed model, competes in the Miss America organization, trains as a competitive championship Irish dancer, and devotes her free time to numerous local and national charities. Oh, and since that wasn’t enough to keep her busy, she recently enrolled in a master’s program at the University of Florida in communications with a specialization in political and strategic communications. 
<p> During her time at UF for undergrad, she was active in student government politics, serving on the campaigning and communications team for the winning political party for 3 years, and state and local politics, serving as first an NPR Morning Edition anchor and then producer and political reporter/anchor for WUFT news. After graduation she was set to take a job in the political news world out of Washington, D.C. but life had other plans.  Her sister’s passing just weeks before graduation led her to return home to help with the family business rather than accept the job right away. </p>
<p> While the world of private aviation is an exciting field, it was not her ultimate calling. She founded her own boutique communications firm in late 2018 to give herself a creative outlet. It quickly grew to much more than she ever could have dreamed! Over the last 3 years, she has had the opportunity to help over 50 companies and individuals find and developed their brand, navigate the world of social media, and market their product in the digital age. This summer, she made the decision to pivot once again and refocus on her original dream. The UF Master’s program offered an amazing opportunity at her alma mater to jumpstart her career and reinvigorate and strengthen some of the skills she learned years ago. With ultimate plans to attend law school, Danielle hopes to combine her passion for politics and the law and her purpose as a communicator to promote change and a greater understanding of the impact of the law on politics.</p> 

<h3> Irish Dance </h3>
<p> When she’s not staring at a computer or phone screen, she spends most of her time dancing. She is both a competitive and professional Irish dancer and tours seasonally with 2 shows! Danielle feels the 15 years she spent in the competitive Irish Dance world truly made her into the person she is today. While she knows Irish Dance contributed to her physical strength and fitness, its effects on her mental strength and work ethic are what she is most grateful for. </p>

<h4> Miss Fort Lauderdale </h4>
<p> Danielle is also a competitor in the Miss America system where she currently represents Fort Lauderdale and recently placed Top 15 this past summer at Miss Florida! Additionally, she serves as a national ambassador for Real Talk by Advanced Recovery systems, a comprehensive, education program designed for high school students that discusses the danger of drugs and alcohol abuse; a legislative advocate with the Everglades Foundation; National Spokesperson for the EW Foundation, advocating for childhood literacy and character education and public education; a mentor for other first generation college students; and is the proud cat mom to what she calls her “pandemic kitties,” Toby and Tilly! </p>
